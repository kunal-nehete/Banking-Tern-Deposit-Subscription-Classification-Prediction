## Banking Term Deposit Subscription Classification Project

A retail bank has conducted a series of direct marketing campaigns via phone calls to promote term deposit subscriptions. The bank wants to use machine learning to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related attributes.

### Objective

Develop a classification model that accurately predicts the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit using historical campaign data. This can help the bank to:
- Improve targeting for future campaigns
- Reduce marketing costs
- Increase campaign success rates

### Dataset Overview
